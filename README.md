# josm-facelift
A technical and project management examination of JOSM

## What are we doing, exactly?

The purpose of the "JOSM Facelift" project is a bit self-referential. Starting with the premise "we'd like to make JOSM better", this 4-week exploration is as much figuring out what we need to explore as exploring it.

That said, our primary goal is this:

### Construct a project plan in the form of User Stories, Technical Tasks, and Epics

This will be related to the following additional artifacts:

* Formal code audit, in relation to:
  * features
  * tech dept
* A publishing/broadcasting format for communication and interaction with the JOSM development community
* JOSM UI (Command Stack, potentially) instrumentation for doing data-driven UI efficiency improvements
* Designs for a user interface reorganization
