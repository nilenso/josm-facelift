Today was a very productive day. During the meeting with Mapbox folks we went through the wish-list of JOSM upgrades. We also discussed the end goals of this exercise.
Later Chethan from the mapping team gave us a walkthrough of using JOSM - adding Turn restrictions using the Mapillary plugin.

The following were the action items from the meeting:
- Block time on Arun's calendar (twice a week for 2 hours on Tue & Thu)
- Create Github repository to store updates
- Go through the existing JOSM issues
- Talk with JOSM core developers / Publicize
- Create Slack channel for JOSM (Done. You should have received email for that)
- Point of contact from Mapbox for shadowing/training/walkthrough (Chethan Gowda. Yay!)

I have set up JOSM with sandbox OSM url for testing out my changes.

Productive day, indeed! I'm editing this in a document we'll keep in git, as requested by Sanjay. You can find these here:
