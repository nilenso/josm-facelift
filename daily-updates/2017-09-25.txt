Today we mostly spent time setting up JOSM + Mapillary for development. (FYI the latest commit on JOSM is not compatible with the plugin. We are using the stable version #12712 for now. We were pointed to this change on IRC as the probable cause for the incompatibility https://josm.openstreetmap.de/ticket/15229). We then went ahead and did small changes to app and the plugin for validating our development process.
We also did analysis and code read through of the Mapillary plugin as well, it appears to be in good shape.

We were thinking of walking to the Mapbox office tomorrow morning to meet the Arun and team. Please let us know if that works.
